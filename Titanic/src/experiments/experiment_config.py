"""
Field by field meaning:

- name: A unique identifier for the experiment.
Readable, short, and descriptive.
example: "Baseline Logistic Regression", "Random Forest with Tuning", "XGBoost with Feature Engineering"

- model_name: The key corresponding to the model in the MODEL_REGISTRY.
Must match one of the keys defined in the MODEL_REGISTRY dictionary.
example: "logreg", "rf", "xgb"

- model_params: A dictionary of fixed parameters to initialize the model with.
example: {"n_estimators": 200, "max_depth": 5}

- features: A list of feature names to be used in the experiment.
example: ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "Embarked"],

- preprocessing: A dictionary defining the preprocessing steps to be applied to the experiment before training the model.
example: {"numeric_imputer": "median", "categorical_imputer": "most_frequent", "scaler": "standard", "encoder": "onehot", "handle_outliers": False}

- evaluation: A dictionary defining the evaluation method and metrics to be used for assessing the model's performance.
example: {"method": "cross_validation", "cv": 5, "scoring": ["accuracy", "precision", "recall", "f1"]}

- use_tuning: A boolean indicating whether to perform hyperparameter tuning for this experiment.
example: True, False

- param_grid: A dictionary defining the hyperparameters and their respective values to be used for tuning.
Only relevant if use_tuning is True.
example: {"n_estimators": [100, 200, 300], "max_depth": [3, 5, 7]}

- notes: A brief description of the experiment and the reasoning behind it, or any additional information about the experiment.
example: "This experiment tests the performance of a Random Forest model with default parameters. Meant to be used as baseline for comparison with tuned models."
